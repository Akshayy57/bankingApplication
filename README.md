- User Can Create a Bank Account using Name and a Customer Id.
- After account is created they can perform following operations:

1. Check Balance
2. Deposit money
3. Withdraw money
4. Check previous transaction.

Here I used Java Concepts like
- Taking Input using **Scanner** class
- **Do-While** loop and **Switch** case to make the program run till user exit.
